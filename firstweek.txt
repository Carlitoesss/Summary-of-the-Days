The first day was pretty dukey... But then, the rest of the week it was pretty good and fun. We learned about certain data types and and structures. The first day was bad because the instructor was 
going into depth without even explaining it to us like we heard it for the first time. The second, third, and fourth day was good because he actually explained everything and went into depth while
explaining and then we had some breaks to let the mental stress out.
